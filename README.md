# med (Minimal text EDitor) -- a very tiny text editor written in c++
A tiny text editor i wrote cuz vim nano and others are too bloated imo. The final executable is only 180 kb so yea

# build/install
med uses CMake, so to build it, just do
``````
cmake .
make
``````

To install, run
``````
make install
``````
as root, and it will install to `/usr/local/bin`.
